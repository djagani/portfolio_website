            <p>
              The colour palette reflects the dynamic atmosphere of the bustling city with a vibrant Cool and Warm mix of colors. Taking inspiration from the city sealink, I've incorporated its iconic stamp seamlessly into the logo design, creating a unique and eye-catching image that captures the city's essence. The colour scheme is a true representation of the city's liveliness and spirit, sure to leave a lasting impression on all who see it.
